# Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis-MySQL-PowerBI-
📘 Project Overview

The Retail Sales Performance Dashboard is an end-to-end analytics project built using MySQL and Power BI to analyze retail sales data and uncover business insights. The project focuses on understanding sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance.

Data was cleaned and queried in MySQL, where key metrics such as total revenue, total quantity, and category-wise sales were derived. The processed data was then connected to Power BI, where an interactive dashboard was created showcasing KPIs, revenue trends, category performance, gender-based sales, and age group analysis.

This project demonstrates a complete data workflow—from SQL-based data analysis to Power BI visualization—highlighting the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights for better business decision-making.
